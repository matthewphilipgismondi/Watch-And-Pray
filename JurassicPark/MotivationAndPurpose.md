Movies with original actors gave important warnings not to play God

Jurassic Park
The Lost World
Jurassic Park III



Later movies sought to carry out other agendas and contained no support from original cast

Justifying evil
Making peace with evil
Learning to cohabitate with evil (Attempting to train and control velociraptors as a bad idea still represents truth to some degree)



But then it totally deviates from anything good

Disguising evil in God's eyes as good when biotech is shared with everyone in a seemingly selfless way (Jurassic Park Rebirth)
This group of actors seems to represent a different set of angels who seem to be more interested in justifying the works of mankind carried out apart from and against God (finding an excuse to justify the genetic creations of mankind by making it seem like a silver lining, a cure for something that all mankind could use, without including the repeated mantra of Dr. Grant who kept getting angry in the earlier movies about how these were not reboots of God's creation but spliced together monsters created to be a circus side-show)
This is an entirely different cast of angels now, the primary ones who I associate with being annoyed by God and having been working to find ways around admitting His way is best. WIth some others playing secondary roles that are endearing as if they are there to keep an eye on the others.
