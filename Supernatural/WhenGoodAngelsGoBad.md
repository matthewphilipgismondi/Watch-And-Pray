How is it that angels who know better could be involved in something so horribly out of line with the truth about spiritual warfare?

And the image of God and Heaven as a negligent body of beings who are only concerned with themselves and others like them who have never messed up makes it seem like it could be about the incredibly awful fate of fallen angels and what they have to deal with, from their perspective, and how they see God and Heaven after being cut off. And so it isn't about what is true from a human perspective but from a fallen angel's perspective. Or even from the perspective of angels cast to Earth out of necessity after the fall of man. And so in that light, the departure from the truth as we humans know it becomes a lesson in empathy delivered in a way that would never be possible otherwise. Even though the two main characters are human beings.

And so it must be intentionally a departure from the truth as we human beings know in order to show:

How ridiculous and impractical the things that witchcraft and the occult deal with really are
How things might have been without the Holy Spirit
The stupid things that angels had to deal with before Jesus Christ
The circumstances that were unfair but necessary for angels to endure because of the imperfection of human beings
