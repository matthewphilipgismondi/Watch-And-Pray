The ability of actual angels to be involved in retelling this story in order to set the record straight and convey contextual information lost in an entirely verbal record as well as corrections to certain details that seem unimportant but really are unfair. The idea that no angel of God would pit people against each other in the story about the Pool of Asclepias.

I say "cheating" because it means that there are angels here on Earth directly involved in the affairs of human beings in ways that are open and publicly seen. But I say it jokingly because they themselves are not open and publicly seen. And the fact that watching this series always illicits an extremely emotional response of love and adoration for what God has done and continues to do which is still perfectly in line with the original message and the record that has survived all these centuries tells me that it is done with and through the Holy Spirit... which makes it not cheating at all. It's just how else would certain things be able to be corrected if not by those who were there at the time and knew first hand what was going on? And knowing this is a real thing not only corrects truth but gives me the feeling even more so that God is in control of all things and will not let His message be lost no matter what.

So it really is not cheating at all.
