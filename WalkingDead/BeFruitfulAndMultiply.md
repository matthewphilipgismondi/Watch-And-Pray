Season 2 Episode 3 in the scene that starts around 10:19:

"How could you do that?" said to Lori Grimes about her getting pregnant shows the attitude that it is irresponsible during times of crisis to cause more stress and add more burdens during times of crisis. The extremely harsh conditions and constant need to be on the move in this show is representative of the Israelites moving around among heartless cruel enemies of the time that could be compared to the zombies in terms of how they had no regard to what they would inflict upon someone during unspeakable sacrificial ceremonies as part of cult practices. So this attitude of bearing children as being seen as a burden to a group of people always on the mood would have put God's people at risk for dying out. In order to prevent this, God made it very clear that He still expected people to procreate and not to see it as an unfortunate side effect and constant worry that might prevent legitimate intimacy where it was needed from being one of the few stress reliefs there would have been among the people in that setting. In this modern world where it is a blessing to have children and an expectation as well as a sign of success, it is very difficult for us to even think about it being otherwise. So in some sense, these zombie apocalypse scenarios are sort of a way for us to understand what life must have felt like for the Israelites of ancient times.
