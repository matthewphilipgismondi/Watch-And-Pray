In several places there are situations where someone is captured and given a chance and forgiveness beyond what even the viewer would consider fair. 

For example, when Gregory convinces the father of the kid that died to attack Maggie, and then he is later put in jail. And someone tells him that they would not still be around if they hadn't been given a second chance.

Or the same thing that Daryl says to the girl they capture among the people who are wearing the masks of dead people after Jesus is killed.
